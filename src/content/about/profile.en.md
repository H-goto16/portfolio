# About Me

Hi, I’m **Haruki Goto**, a frontend engineer based in Japan.
I work full-time at **Univearth Inc.** while also taking on freelance projects for several startups to broaden my experience and technical perspective.

## Story

I’ve been interested in computers since childhood, but during junior and senior high school I focused mainly on club activities and had little chance to touch one.
After growing tired of entrance exam studies, I decided to pursue a career where I could use computers creatively and started learning programming seriously after entering university.
Now, I mainly focus on web development using **TypeScript, React, and Next.js**.

At university, I joined a robotics team where I developed robots using **Python** and **ROS**, and participated in the **RoboCup Japan Open** twice.
Through these experiences, I learned not only technical skills but also teamwork, problem-solving, and the importance of robust error handling.

Currently, I’m primarily engaged in **B2B software development**, while also sharing knowledge and insights through platforms like **Qiita** and **Zenn**.
